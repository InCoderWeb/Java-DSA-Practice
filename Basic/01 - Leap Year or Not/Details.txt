Problem Statement

Given an integer representing a year, determine if it is a leap year. A leap year has an extra day (February 29), so it contains 366 days instead of the usual 365.

Rules for Leap Years

A year is a leap year if:

It is divisible by 4, and:
It is not divisible by 100, unless:
It is also divisible by 400.

--------------------

In other words:

Years divisible by 400 are leap years.
Years divisible by 100 but not 400 are not leap years.
Years divisible by 4 but not 100 are leap years.
Years not divisible by 4 are not leap years.

--------------------

Approach
To solve this problem, youâ€™ll need to use conditional statements to implement these rules.

--------------------

Example 1
Input: year = 2020
Explanation:

2020 is divisible by 4.
2020 is not divisible by 100.
Therefore, 2020 is a leap year.
Output: True

--------------------
Example 2
Input: year = 1900
Explanation:

1900 is divisible by 4.
1900 is divisible by 100.
1900 is not divisible by 400.
Therefore, 1900 is not a leap year.
